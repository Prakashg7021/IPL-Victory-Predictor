# IPL-Victory-Predictor
IPL Victory Predictor is a Flask-based web application that forecasts IPL match outcomes 📈🏆. Using a pre-trained machine learning model and data from 2008 to 2023 [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020/data), it delivers real-time predictions on winning probabilities based on match inputs. Perfect for cricket fans and data enthusiasts alike, this tool offers insights into team performance and victory determinants 💪📊.

## Technical Details

- **Scripting Language:** Python
- **Hosting Platform:** Flask (HTML, CSS)


## Project Steps

1. **🧹 Data Cleaning and Manipulation:**
   Extensive data cleaning was performed to ensure accuracy in the prediction model. This involved removing rows with null values and refining the dataset to enhance overall quality, which improves model performance.

2. **🔬 Model Creation:**
   A logistic regression model was developed using the cleaned dataset. Logistic regression, a robust machine learning algorithm for classification tasks, was selected for its effectiveness in predicting IPL team victories. The model, trained on historical IPL data, provides insights into team performance and factors influencing match outcomes.

3. **💻 User Interface:**
   An intuitive and visually appealing user interface was designed to enhance user experience. The interface allows users to input match details and view prediction results seamlessly, making it easy to explore IPL team performance and predictions.

4. **🚀 Deployment:**
   The application is hosted on Flask, providing a user-friendly platform for interacting with the IPL Victory Predictor.
